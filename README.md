Reply Copilot is a response generator designed to assist with customer feedback and online community management. Combing through thousands of online reviews and social comments is a difficult task for many social media professionals, and thinking of unique replies to each response can easily wear down the most tenacious of copywriters.

Considered an industry-wide best practice, replying to each review, or social media post, shows consumers that a brand cares enough about their audience to engage them on a personal level. There is also the added benefit of keywords. It usually takes a team of community managers and strict brand messaging guidelines to respond to all feedback. Now, with Reply Copilot, you can reply with thousands of sentiment-based responses, each specifically targeted based on the Net Promotor Score.

Developed through a Startup Institute partnership with online review management software provider ReviewTrackers, this tool is free for anyone to use.
