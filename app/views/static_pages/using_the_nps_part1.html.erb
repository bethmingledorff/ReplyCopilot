			Times have never been better than they are now in the field of consumer analytics and business intelligence.
		</p>


		<p>
			Thanks to significant advances with the way we capture and reply to customer feedback, such as point-of-sale tracking and survey-based metrics, we can now paint a better and more accurate picture of what customers prefer and why.
		</p>

		<p>
			In 2003, Bain & Company, a global consulting firm based out of Boston, introduced a one-question survey that has proven to be one of the best and most accurate tools to measure and understand the customer sentiment toward a service or a product: the Net Promoter Score. The firm began using the survey with some of their clients, and today NPS is one of the most popular tools for marketing and business strategists, equipping those tasked with determining the direction of a business with a key piece of data that is highly predictive of customers’ likelihood to repurchase or recommend a product or service.

			The Net Promoter Score asks a single post-transactional question that surprisingly provides businesses with a variety of actionable insights, and one of the most valuable Key Performance Indicators available to business organizations. The question is simple:
		</p>	

		<p><i>
			How likely is it that you would recommend Company X (or Product X) to a friend or colleague?
		</i></p>

		<p>
			Instead of a binary answer, those answering a Net Promoter Survey provide a linear 
			assessment of their experience, with a rating scale of 0-10, ten being extremely likely to recommend and zero not likely at all. The responses are divided into three distinct categories or groups as follows:
		</p>


		<p>
			“Promoters” are highly loyal customers who conduct unprompted, repeat business and have no hesitation recommending the product or service to their friends, family, or colleagues (scores of nine and 10).
		</p>

		<p>
			“Passives” are satisfied but unenthusiastic customers, and your most vulnerable group since they can easily be persuaded to patronage the competition, should the competition be ready to bridge the experiential gap of what the customer wishes to receive and what you are delivering.
			Conversely, just as this group (with scores of seven and eight) can easily stop frequenting your business, the same group, but from your competitor’s client pool, presents a superior opportunity for your business to gain wallet share if you have the business savvy and offerings to coax them to your side by carefully deciphering your competitors’ shortcomings.		</p>

		<p>
			“Detractors” are highly dissatisfied customers who are very unlikely to generate repeat business, much less give your business a verbal or written endorsement. These customers present a significant risk to your business organization since they are highly likely to give a negative reference about your business (scores of six and below).
